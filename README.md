<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We all seen services that provides virtual books at outrageous subscription prices and at Dekoo we think that is a stopping point for a lot of people. This fact inspired us to build a service that will provide access to free reading titles along with accessible prices for anyone and everyone.

Here's why:

- 33% of people surveyed feel happier after reading.
- 55% of people surveyed feel more relaxed after reading
- 70% of people surveyed believe that reading has a positive impact on their careers.
- Reading stimulates the part of the brain that deals with depression. Self-help books, can help ward off depressive occurrences.
- Being well-spoken and articulate can help increase job performance and self-esteem.

### Key Features

- Creating reading lists
  - Public and private reading lists that you can share on your profile

  - Reviews are important in picking the right book for you, our review system allows other readers and critics to leave their opinion on the book.
- Dark/Light mode

### Built With

The entire codebase consists in **TypeScript**, here is a list of technologies used:

- **NestJs**: Back-end framework

### Folder structure

```sh
dekoo/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets       # Vendor files
â”œâ”€â”€ docs         # Compodoc Code documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ src          # Source files
â””â”€â”€ tests        # E2E tests
```

### Code Style

- We run Prettier `on-commit`, which means you can write code in whatever style you want and it will be automatically formatted according to the common style when you run `git commit`. We also have ESLint set up, along with Jest tests.
- We use `commitlint` with `config-conventional`, which means all commit messages should follow conventional rules.
